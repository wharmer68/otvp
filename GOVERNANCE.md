# OTVP Governance

## Current Stage: Founder-Led

**Maintainer:** Bil Harmer

Specification changes are proposed via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests. Major changes are discussed openly before merging.

As the community grows, OTVP will transition to a formal governance model with a Technical Steering Committee, Certification Board, and Domain Working Groups.

All OTVP specifications and reference implementations are Apache 2.0. No patents. No royalties. No vendor lock-in.
